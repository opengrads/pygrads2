---------------------------
Bugs fixes in galab, gacm. See ChangeLog for details.

Version 1.1.7 of 2012-12-12
---------------------------
Annual refresher release with several bug fixes.

Version 1.1.b5 of 2011-0707
---------------------------
Updated to work with IPython 0.11. It now uses the *subprocess* module 
instead of popen2. New methods still undergoing tests.

Version 1.1.4 of 2010-06-25
---------------------------
Fixed UNDEF issue with expr() method, added query('ctlinfo')

Version 1.1.3 of 2009-10-01
---------------------------
Minor bug fixes, in particular the interp() method.

Version 1.1.2 of 2009-05-10
---------------------------

   This is pretty much a bugfix release of PyGrADS. It includes a
better handling of the e-dimension under GrADS v2.0, returning a
single e-dimension under GrADS v1.x. It also includes teh
ga.query("time") method which returns both GrADS and Unix time
representations. The default GrADS binary is now "grads" instead of
"gradshdf". Recall that under GrADS v2.0.a5.oga.5 and v1.10.r2.oga
"grads" includes support for most data formats, including OpenGrADS.

IMPORTANT: Do not use the new colorized text option in GrADS (-C option)
           with PyGrADS as it will confuse the parser.

   It is strongly recommended that you use GrADS 2.0.oga.5 or later
for a fully functional PyGrADS under GrADS v2.0, including the exp()
and imp() methods. If you are still using the Legacy GrADS v1.x
releases, it is recommended that you upgrade to the GrADS v1.10.r2.oga
for fully support of the expr() method, something that is essential if
using tge Java interface under Jython. See the ChangeLog for a complte
list of bug fixes and new features.

Version 1.1.0 of 2008-09-06
---------------------------

   This release of PyGrADS supports the new Matplotlib 0.98 API, while
being compabilitiby with previous versions of Matplotlib.  Exchange of
data with GrADS v2.0.a3 is now supported with the new method
expr(). This version has several internal patches to facilitate
operation under Java/Jython. A separate package *JyGrADS*, based on
PyGrADS, provides an interface to Java and Matlab through Jython.
