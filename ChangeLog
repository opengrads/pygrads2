	ChangeLog for PyGrADS
	---------------------
2016-03-21 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.2.0
	* galab.py: small tweak so that clines and cmap can both be
	  specified; implemented projection "geos_" as a small
 	  variation on "geos". Moved sample methods to ganum. 
	* ganum.py: now eof() method handles undefs. Includes interp()
	  function from basemap here to avoid dependency. Moved sample
	  methods previously in galab to here.
	* gacore.py: now cmd() method can do string interpolation.
	
2014-11-21 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.1.10
	* gacore.py: bug fix where if one queries ctlinfo and tries to
    	  obtain the xlevs and ylevs information from the ctl file, it 
	  does not return that info; contributed by Rahul Mahajan.
	* galab.py: handle change of behavior in matplotlib 1.2 where
	  pil_to_array() now returns an upsidedown array.

2014-05-18 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.1.9
	* Maintenance release.
	* galab: now basemap resolution and area_thresh have sticking
	  defaults; changed spelling: area_tresh -> area_thresh.
	* gacm: a few opaque log-scale color maps
	
2013-01-28 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.1.8
	* gacm: removed __call__ method; default works fine; this fixes
	  issues with new versions of Matplotlib.
	* galab: now passes **kwopts down to contour so that
	  ga.contour(x,levels=(-3,-2)) works.
	* galab: colorbar now can use a new basemap method, if present

2012-12-12 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.1.7
	* Annual refresher release.
	* Several small bug fixes to interpolation and what not.
	* gaya is still experimental.
	* galab has method sampleKML that should interpolate fields
	  to locations in a KML file produced with Google Maps. 
	* Known_Issues: gacm still having issues with more recent 
	  versions of EPD.
	
2011-08-08 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.1.b5
	* Beta version: new methods still undergoing tests
	* gacore.py now uses the subprocess module instead of popen2
	* pygrads upgraded to work with IPython 0.11; it should be
	  backward compatible with IPython 0.10.
	* Introduced method imex() to display graphics buffer on
	  matplotlib canvas; this is a preliminary implementation
	  that shold eventually render the plot locally from the
	  instructions in the grads graphics buffer.
	* Introduced "tyme" (datetime representation of time)
	   in GaGrid and query("dims") handle.
	* added methods gat2dt() and dt2gat() for converting 
	  between datetime and grads time representations
	* added method sampleXYT for (lat,lon,time) interpolation.
	
2010-06-25 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.1.4
	* gacore/ganum: fixed undef issue with expr() method.
 	
2010-02-20 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, __Version 1.1.4__
	* gacore:  added query("ctlinfo"), partial.
 	
2009-11-02 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, __Version 1.1.4__
	* gacore:  added handling of .nc4 and .xtl in open()
	
2009-07-30 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.1.3
	* galab:
	  - commented out "if isinteractive(): show" as it was 
	    blocking on Mac OS X
	  - fixing bugs in interp()

2009-05-10 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.1.2
	* gacore: 
	  - revised e-dimension support so that it returns a
	    valid e-dimension environment even with GrADS v1.x
	  - P. Romero intrduced ga.query("time") method.
	* query: 
	  - added bracketing index attributes (dh.xi,dh.yi,...)
	  - added query("udct") and query("udft")
	* cmd: generalized so that we can provide a single command
	  or a list of commands separated by a newline ('\n')
	* pygrads: GrADS binary now defaults to "grads".
	
2009-03-21 Mike Fiorino <fiorino@opengrads.org>, Version 1.1.1
	* added support for 5th dimension in gacore for grads2.0
	
2009-01-25 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.1.x
	* Fixed usage of user specific blue marble

2008-09-06 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.1.0
	* Updated for Matplotlib 0.98; should work with older versions as well
	* gacore: 
	  - added eval() and coords() methods 
	  - several updates to query() to provide an easier way to 
	    iterate over variables (by Daniel)
	  - add attributes HAS_UDXT/HAS_IPC 
	  - hooks for Jython and Matlab interface: jquery()/jcoords()
	  - GaHandle is now on a separate module file
	* ganum: added get() method based on eval()
	* galab: 
	  - in _imshow(), reset lat longitude to -180 when departure
 	    from it is very small (because of round off errors); 
	    this is necessary to keep the map.transform code from
	    raising an exception.
	  - added method interp() to interpolated gridded fields to
	    "observation locations" (lon/lat for now); use this for
	    curtain plots.
          - added method expr() which does not require IPC extension
	  - if IPC is not available exp() reverts to expr(), and imp()
	    raises an exception (rather than lock up); with this it
	    now works with grads v2.0.a3 or later
	* ipygrads - fixed bug in "ii" shortcut
	
2008-02-14 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.0.8
	* Adjustments for running under Windows with native (non-cygwin) 
	  Python
	* examples: No longer imports basemap.cm as it breaks older versions
	* gacm: added argument "bytes" to ColormapAlpha for compatibility
	with newer Matplotlib.
	
2008-01-28 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.0.7
	* Documentation touch up for sf.net distribution

2008-01-01 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.0.6
	* Converted to a python "package"
	* Introduced galab (pylab/matplotlib interface)
	* Introduced gacm (color tables)
	* Introduced handling of missing values with masking (ma, array's)
	* Split off ganum.py from grads.py; now graads.py is so vanilla 
	  that may run under Jython. 
	* Removed SciPy dependency

2007-11-08 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>, Version 1.0.4
	* Added NumPy interface
	* Introduced pytests

2006-03-18 Arlindo da Silva <dasilva@opengrads.org>
	* First experimental version with no data exchange with GrADS
